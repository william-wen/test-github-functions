Chapter One: Encounter

Today was my first day of class at University. My friend recommended that I try my hand at a couple of classes to see if I could regain the past I had lost. If I still couldn’t remember anything, at least I’d be doing something productive. 

“Of course getting an education will help you live a better life down the line,” John told me, “but it’ll also help take your mind of things.”

He was right. 

John was a member of the US Special Forces. He took part in a mission to apprehend the leader of a major terrorist organization multiple governments were attempting to track down. Near the end of the mission, his squadron, thinking they had cornered the coalition’s major actors, had realized they had been led into a trap. The terrorists, lying await inside the room, had rigged themselves with explosives. Having opened the door, John’s squadron braced themselves, preparing for the inevitable. But there was no explosion. The entire room was indeed splattered with blood, as if the terrorists had blew themselves up. But there were no bodies in the room. Nothing but a boy laying unconscious in the centre, with a single strand of sunlight, passing through the cracks of the wall, illuminating his face. That boy was me.
